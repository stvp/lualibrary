# Contributors

Special thanks to the authors and contributors to the scripts in this
repository. A few of our examples were taken from the public domain: if you know
the original authors, let us know and we'll update this!

Want your name here? Help us out and add a new Lua script for other peoples'
use, or help us improve the documentation.
